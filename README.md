# rbg_led_controller
RGB LED controller BLE peripheral with Apache Cordova app

This project is a combination of an Apache Cordova app built in a class I attended at Bluetooth World 2017. 
The app was an LED animation controller for the BBC micro:bit development board. I changed the app to controller
the color and brightness of the RGB LED on the PSoC 4200 BLE pioneer kit. 

I have only checked in the files necessary. Follow the steps on this website to set up Cordova and create the
project. Then replace the www folder with the one checked in here.

The PSoC code was adapted from the custom profile example from app note AN91162.
